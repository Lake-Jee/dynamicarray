# C Dynamic Array

An extremely simple (and not type-safe) dynamic array implementation in C.

This code is a fork from [zaunlok](https://github.com/zauonlok)'s [darray.h](https://github.com/zauonlok/renderer/blob/master/renderer/core/darray.h) and [darray.c](https://github.com/zauonlok/renderer/blob/master/renderer/core/darray.c) with some minimal syntax and name changes.


## Note from Lake Jee
Use this as the following:
```
// Add third-party libraries
#include "third-party\dynamicarray\array.h"
#include "third-party\dynamicarray\array.c"
```
